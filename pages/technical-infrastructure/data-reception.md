## Data reception

Uniform processes (such as quality control and standardisation) to receive (download) or access (API) both data and metadata in a consistent way enabling infrastructure to adhere to global standards and principles (e.g. GA4GH, FAIR) for genotypic and phenotypic data. Data reception means logically describing datasets to an extent that they can become actionable on the 1+MG infrastructure even if they are stored nationally or locally.

Physical transfer of data into the 1+MG Data Node (when required) incl., legal transfer of data to enable visibility in a data catalogue. While 1+MG could be able to provide access to current genomic data collections across Europe the 1+MG Framework define the quality requirements for a data collection to be 1+MG compliant (e.g. re-consent and data management activities could be required for a existing dat collection to be 1+MG compliant).


### [Htsget](https://www.ga4gh.org/product/htsget/)
htsget is a data streaming protocol that allows genetic data to be securely streamed from one location to another. It supports range-based queries,for example a user can request a single region, exon or gene to be streamed to a location. htsget is a secure protocol, with alldata transmission running over https. The use of htsget can be used to restrict access to genomic regions, preventing users streaming data from certain genes for example.
