## [B1MG Secure cross-border data access roadmap](https://zenodo.org/record/5018526#.YXGlNNbMKdY): June 2021

A  roadmap presented here is to define the timelines to provide a proof of concept demonstrator of secure cross border data access, describe the technologies required to develop such a demonstrator, and to detail the work that has gone into determining the roadmap and requirement for the proof of concept demonstrator. The roadmap also outlines how it is expected that the work carried out towards the initial proof of concept will support the developing roadmap for 2022 and beyond, as the proof of concept evolves from a demonstrator with synthetic data to a production system accessing real genetic and phenotypic data.

## [B1MG Secure Access Demonstrator](https://zenodo.org/record/7590822)

The 1+MG data infrastructure needs to be defined to ensure data managed within the federated network are compliant with the European and national legislation on data protection, security, and ELSI principles agreed in 1+MG. At the same time the aim is to maximise the Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability and Reusability of the 1+MG data, according to FAIR principles. 

In this deliverable a Proof of Concept (PoC) was built using existing standards, applications, and services to demonstrate cross border data access for two 1+MG use cases; rare disease and cancer. The intention is to create a technical infrastructure baseline and advancement for the next iteration of implementation data protection principles according to the GDPR
