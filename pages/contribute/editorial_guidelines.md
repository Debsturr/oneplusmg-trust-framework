## Content Types & Editorial Guidelines

There are two content types contained within the 1+MG Framework:

## 1+MG Core Framework

This is the European-level, agreed-upon content that is based on approved deliverables.  
These are included after being reviewed by Work Package leads or their assigned deputies.  These reviewers ensure that this content is verified for technical accuracy and that it meets the Code of Conduct.  The reviewers have the authority to edit and publish this content.

The wider contributor community, i.e. members of the project, can draft and submit content and submit edits.  However, all content and edits must be approved as stated above before it can be added to the 1+MG Framework website.
## National Content

This is supporting content, such as training material, guidance & country-specific solutions, developed by the national Nodes and submitted as references by use for the other national Nodes.

This content needs to be reviewed by National Mirror Group leads or their assigned deputies to ensure that it accurately represents national content and it meets the Code of Conduct. The reviewers have the authority to edit and publish this content.

The wider contributor community, i.e. members of the Nodes or National Mirror Group, can draft and submit content and submit edits.  However, all content and edits must be approved as stated above before it can be added to the Trust Framework website.
