The 1+ Million Genomes (1+MG) initiative aims to enable secure access to genomics and the
corresponding clinical data across Europe for better research, personalised healthcare and
health policy making. Since the Digital Day 2018, 24 EU countries, the United Kingdom and
Norway signed the Member States’ Declaration ‘Towards access to at least 1 million sequenced
genomes in the EU by 2022’ that consists of stepping up efforts towards creating a European
data infrastructure for genomic data and implementing common national rules enabling
federated data access. The initiative forms part of the EU’s agenda for the Digital Transformation
of Health and Care and is aligned with the goals of the European Health Data Space (EHDS). The 1+MG Roadmap, published in February 2020, sets out the priorities for the period 2020-2022 .
