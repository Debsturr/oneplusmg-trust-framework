## Introduction to 1+MG, B1MG, and GDI

The 1+ Million Genomes (1+MG) initiative aims to enable secure access to genomics and the
corresponding clinical data across Europe for better research, personalised healthcare and
health policy making. Since the Digital Day 2018, 24 EU countries, the United Kingdom and
Norway signed the Member States’ Declaration ‘Towards access to at least 1 million sequenced
genomes in the EU by 2022’ that consists of stepping up efforts towards creating a European
data infrastructure for genomic data and implementing common national rules enabling
federated data access. The initiative forms part of the EU’s agenda for the Digital Transformation
of Health and Care and is aligned with the goals of the European Health Data Space (EHDS). The 1+MG Roadmap, published in February 2020, sets out the priorities for the period 2020-2022.

Combination of agreed on deliverables and submissions from the community for pieces outside of the project (training, etc)

### [Data submission policy](https://zenodo.org/record/8199373) (relevant for data submitters and national nodes): 
In this document three policy recommendations are outlined: 1: minimal standards for inclusion of special groups of data subjects such as minors, persons not able to consent, vulnerable population groups, minorities, and deceased persons; 2: minimal standards for feedback provision to data subjects; 3: minimal standards on how to deal with incidental findings.

### Future Deliverables:

* Consent and transparency checklist (relevant for data submitters)

* Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) template (relevant for all actors)
    * A Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) of the cross-border processing of genomes for research in a pan-European genome initiative
* Data access policy (relevant for all actors)
* GDPR:
    * Purpose and Recital 33 in the GDPR: Exploration of what constitutes a valid purpose under the GDPR and interpretation of Recital 33 about broad consent in this context
    * Secondary use and further processing: Analysis of the differences between secondary use and further processing as defined in the GDPR and the possibility of building the legal basis under Art. 6.1 on further processing. 
    * Roles under the GDPR for secondary use: Identification of roles under the GDPR for the main processing operations for 1+MG
    * Legal basis for the core processing operations: Analysis of the availability of legal bases under Art. 6.1 GDPR and Art. 9.2 GDPR for the controllers along the main processing operations
* Translation of ethical and legal requirements into policies and recommendations
    * Policy for special (vulnerable) subjects and groups: Recommendations on how to consider the vulnerability and rights of special subjects such as children and special groups subject to vulnerability
    * Policy for incidental findings: Recommendations for dealing with incidental findings in 1+MG
    * Policy for communication of general research results: Information of data subjects and the general public on outcome from research use 
    * Data governance for research use: Policy for the data inclusion in 1+MG, the data access procedures and requirements for data use; for research use only – data governance for other data use to follow
    * Transparency and consent guidance: Minimum standards and recommendations to be considered for information sheets and for obtaining consent for secondary use of data 
    * Data Protection / ELSI by Design and Default (DPbDD recommendations): Recommendations for the information management and IT infrastructure features to comply with legal requirements and to implement the data governance
    * GDPR requirements as influencing factors for the legal framework of 1+MG: Discussion and recommendations on the legal framework for the implementation of 1+MG as a genomic infrastructure with respect to the legal instrument for establishment and the legally compliant operations; document shared with the 1+MG Group of Signatory Countries
    * Legal instruments for the sustainable implementation of the 1+MG genomic infrastructure: Analysis of possible legal instruments that could be used to create the legal framework that the 1+MG infrastructure could build on and their evaluation with respect to suitability for 1+MG needs
