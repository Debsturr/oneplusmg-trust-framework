title: TEHDAS’ Data Lifecycle
---

This section outlines the elements of the Data Lifecycle as defined by the TEHDAS joint action.  It includes a description of each stage, guidance, standards, and other relevant considerations.

This cycle has gone through multiple iterations by TEHDAS and we examine the connection of the 1+MG Framework with the [proposed Data Lifecycle as of June 2023](https://tehdas.eu/results/tehdas-proposals-for-the-implementation-of-ehds-technical-infrastructure/).

The above table lists the stages of the TEHDAS Data Lifecycle (which encompases both the Data Preparation phase and the User Journey phase) and the associated elements of the 1+MG Framework.  The 1+MG Framework Governance and ELSI recommendations are relevant across the Data Lifecycle.

There are some elements that fall outside of this mapping.  The TEHDAS Project Finalization stage is related to disclosure of results, which currently falls outside of the scope of 1+MG’s technical recomendations, but there are some relevant ELSI policies.  Additionally, there are some elements of the 1+MG Framework which fall outside of the TEHDAS Data Lifecycle including the Implementation of Genomics into Healthcare resources (focused on supporting national efforts at using genomic data within personalised medicine) and the specific scientific Use Case resources.
