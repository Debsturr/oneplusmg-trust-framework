## Framework Contents and EC Projects

The 1+MG Framework is meant to provide a user friendly interface to navigate the guidelines and recommendations provided by the 1+MG Working Groups and the project supporting the initiative across the different phases of its implementation: currently the  Beyond 1 Million Genomes (B1MG) and the European Genomic Data Infrastructure (GDI) projects.

It will contain the set of agreed outputs and guidance on:

* ELSI aspects to be considered to ensure data is properly consented and Data access committees and/or permit authorities have appropriate guidance while granting access to data.
* Data standards to be applied to fulfil FAIR principles
* Technical Infrastructure standards and APIs to be implemented
* Data quality guidelines

B1MG defined the initial architecture, shared interfaces, and possible virtualisation platforms required to achieve technical interoperability. In addition, the proposed infrastructure must support semantic interoperability, so a variety of international standards were proposed to support this.
