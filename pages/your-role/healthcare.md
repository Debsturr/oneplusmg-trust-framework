Both 1+MG and B1MG projects will contribute to the advancement of precision medicine by creating a secure and accessible infrastructure for storing and sharing genomic data. 

This infrastructure will enable researchers and healthcare providers to gain access to a wealth of genomic data that can be used to improve our understanding of disease, collaborate more effectively, share insights and best practices, and develop new treatments and therapies based on genomic data. By creating a common infrastructure for genomic research, these projects will accelerate the translation of genomic research into clinical practice and ultimately improve patient outcomes.
