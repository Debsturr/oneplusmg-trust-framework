## What is data access?

A mechanism(s) by which the data controller can authorise access to select dataset(s)

## Standards and Reference implementations

* #### [LS AAI](https://elixir-europe.org/platforms/compute/aai/overview) 

    LS AAI uses the federated identity management model, which allows users to authenticate with their home organisation and then be granted access to resources and services from other organisations in the federation. The system is based on the Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) protocol, which provides a standard way for exchanging authentication and authorization data between different organisations.

    The LS AAI system provides a range of services, including single sign-on, attribute-based access control, and group management. It is designed to be highly scalable and can be integrated with a wide range of life science research infrastructure, such as data repositories, compute platforms, and web services.

    The system has been developed and tested in collaboration with a range of life science research projects and organisations across Europe, and has been shown to be effective in providing secure and easy access to distributed resources. The LS AAI system is also open source, which means that it can be adapted and customised to meet the specific needs of different research communities.


* #### [REMS](https://rems-demo.rahtiapp.fi/)

    REMS (Research Environment Metadata Standard) is a tool for describing the software and data environment used in scientific research. The project was developed by the Finnish IT Center for Science (CSC) and is now maintained by a community of contributors.

    The main purpose of REMS is to provide a standardised way to document the research environment, which can help with reproducibility, sharing, and collaboration. The metadata collected by REMS includes information on the software and hardware used, as well as the data sources and any custom scripts or workflows.

* #### [GitHub](https://github.com/CSCfi/rems/)

    The repository contains documentation, examples, and tools for working with REMS metadata, including a Python library for parsing and validating metadata files. The repository also includes a web-based form for creating REMS metadata files, as well as a command-line interface for working with the metadata.

* #### [eduGAIN](https://edugain.org/)

    eduGAIN is a global authentication and authorization infrastructure for research and education federations. It allows users from different federations to access resources and services from other federations in a secure and trusted way, without having to create new accounts or share sensitive information.

    The eduGAIN system is based on a network of interconnected identity federations, which are organizations that provide a common framework for secure and privacy-preserving authentication and authorization. Each federation is responsible for verifying the identity of its users and providing them with access to resources and services from within the federation.
    
    When a user from one federation wants to access a resource or service from another federation, the eduGAIN system provides a trusted connection between the two federations. This is done through a process called federation-to-federation (F2F) authentication, which allows the user to authenticate with their home federation and then be granted access to resources and services from the other federation.* 


## B1MG Maturity Level Model

Domain III (Ethics, Legislation and Policy) and Domain VIII (Data Management Standards and Infrastructure) contain relevant guidance for evaluating your country or regionâ€™s current maturity and providing a [framework]((https://b1mg-project.eu/resources/maturity-level-model)) for advancement.
